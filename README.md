# go-clock
Have you ever wanted to use your goban and stones to tell the time? No? Well now you can with the Go Clock.

Go is an ancient boardgame that originated in China about 3000 years ago (it's also commonly known as
Igo, weiqi and baduk).
For millenia is has been impractical to use the game equipment to accurately tell the time, but the advent
of modern computers has given our team of highly skilled engineers, physicists and Go enthusiasts enough
free time to finally make the dream reality.
