# The Go Clock

Have you ever wanted to use a Go board to tell the time? No? Well now you can!

Go is an ancient board game that originated in China about 3000 years ago (it's also commonly known as Igo, Weiqi and Baduk).

For millennia it has been impractical to use the game equipment to accurately tell the time, but advances in computer technology and recent breakthroughs in robotics have given our team of highly skilled machine learning engineers, physicists and Go enthusiasts enough free time to hack this app together.

A working version is currently pretending to be the documentation of this project on GitHub!
